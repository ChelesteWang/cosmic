practice of D2R.\nThis repository is where we develop it together with the community. Not only do we work on code and issues here, we also publish our roadmap , development guide. This source code is available to everyone under the standard MIT license.\nAbout Cosmic Design\n\n🚧 ing...\n\nHow it works\nThe template required a minimum dependencies. Only Vite is used for building, nothing more.\nProject Structure\nThe structure of this template is very similar to the structure of a monorepo.\nThe entire source code of the program is divided into three modules (packages) that are bundled each independently:\n\nsrc/core\nInclude common dependencies, such as components, utils, ipc.\nsrc/app\nElectron main script.\nsrc/workbench\nElectron web page.\n\nCosmic Components\n\nComponents StoryBook\nsrc/core/components\n\nCompile App\nNext step is run packaging and compilation a ready for distribution Electron app for macOS, Windows and Linux with \"auto update\" support out of the box.\nTo do this, using the electron-builder:\n\nIn npm script compile: This script is configured to compile the application as quickly as possible. It is not ready for distribution, is compiled only for the current platform and is used for debugging.\nIn GitHub Action: The application is compiled for any platform and ready-to-distribute files are automatically added to the draft GitHub release.\n\nContribution\nSee Wiki Contributing\n\nSource Code Organization\nUser Interface\nColor Set\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2020 qiansc\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
